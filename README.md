## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned mainly how to use the "display: flex" property to organize elements in a flex container. Styling properties were also practiced. However, the most important aspect was breaking away from the routine of just seeing exercises in a class and facing challenges that required me to find ways to overcome them.

### Continued development

This website is thought to be only for desktop but as we know the web need's responsive website and this is the next target to me, develop the responsive.
